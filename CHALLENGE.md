# CHFindYuhRoom Challenge

As indicated, this project is but an API, that exposes some data.
However, it would be unreasonable for anyone to expect viewers and students to look at just raw, json data 🤮.

As such! We are having a challenge, for students to create a User Interface that will make use of the API, to provide a much more user friendly experience!

For more information about the service itself, refer to `./README.md`.

The base URL for the api will be:

[CH RoomFinduh API](https://chroomfinduh.onrender.com)

To see the list of available endpoints, visit:

[CH RoomFinduh Endpoints](https://chroomfinduh.onrender.com/docs)

## How the Challenge will work

With the API endpoints, and related data exposed, students will then be able to make use of the API, and build a User Interface around it. 

User Interfaces can be Command Line, Website, Mobile App, or any other reasonable format.

The challenge will run for five (5) weeks, starting November 22nd, 2025, until December 27th 2025.
It will be running for so long, because I am aware that students will be in exam season, so want to give plenty of time for participants to play around with the data and experiment.

Once the challenge is over, participants will be expected to record a video of their UI to Youtube (unlisted video is fine), and will submit both the YouTube link, and the Github Repository link to a Submission form that will be provided.

As submissions come in, the YouTube links will be shared with other particpants, and viewers, which will allow everyone to check out everyone's UI.

A secondary form will then be sent out, for which participants will be able to vote for each other's submissions (Yes, you can even vote for your own, albeit you'll only be able to vote once.)

Voting will occur between December 30th 2025 and January 8th 2026.

Then after another 2 weeks, on the 10th of January 2026, the winner will be announced, and their UI will be the chosen one that other students will be able to use!

Ideally, I will also look to acquire some prizes if I can (don't get the hopes up too high, but I will try).

## Getting Started

Students will be expected to create a repository on GitHub, of which their code will be stored.
Students should similarly refer to [CH RoomFinduh Endpoints](https://chroomfinduh.onrender.com/docs) to see available endpoints.

Given that students will be able to create whatever UI they please, the only pre-requisite will be knowing how to use an API, and render received information in your application.

## Rules

1. AI is allowed of course, but for the sake of fun and learning, try not to submit a 100% ai generated solution.
1. When voting, each participant will only be able to vote once.
1. While anyone can take part in the challenge, only students with an @mycavehill.uwi.edu email address will be able to be considered for winning submissions (this may be subject to change).
